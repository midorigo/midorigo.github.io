<h2>2025 April 12</h2>
<p>This marks the start of my personal blog. I am going to use this page to share my progress as I work towards the distant goal of passing the Kanji Kentei Level 1 (漢字検定1級). Later I hope to host study resources that may be of help to a wider audience.</p>
<p>From the brutally low pass rate and total number of non-native kanji learners to have ever passed the exam being few enough to count on two hands, Level 1 of the Kanji Kentei had an inherent allure to me from an early stage in my self-study career. I had shut it down as a serious goal due to its apparent difficulty, but the more I studied, the more doable it seemed, and the less I cared about how impractical of a goal it was. Now I believe it is 100% possible in a reasonable time frame with adequate effort and study methods.</p>
<p>Recently, I passed the Kanji Kentei Level 2 in Vancouver, Canada. I put a tremendous amount of effort into studying for the exam, and despite being internally convinced that I had failed due to nervousness on the day of the exam, I fortunately passed with a score of 169/200. After taking a break from studying, I still felt that I could go much farther, and experienced a resurgence of motivation. Currently, my plan is to travel to Japan in order to take levels 3 and 2 of the Nihongo Kentei and levels Pre-1 and 1 of the Kanji Kentei back-to-back on the 13th and 14th of June, 2026. </p>
<p>My main resources are the official Kanzen Seifuku (完全征服) textbooks. For the next month, I will be throttling my efforts in order to focus on another language learning side-project leading up to a family trip, but once I return I will be dedicating between 1~2 hours a day on average to studying for the Kanji Kentei. At a rate of 1 page per day, that projects finishing around the end of the year. I haven’t yet developed a study plan for the Nihongo Kentei, but I expect it to require a more creative approach while not demanding as much time. The lower levels of the respective tests are my real goal, and the higher levels are something of a stretch goal; I have no expectations of passing the Kanji Kentei Level 1 this year, but depending on how things go, I DO intend to pass it the following year in 2027.</p>
<p>I hope to make more constructive blog posts about my progress, experiments, improvements and setbacks. I have very little confidence in my writing ability and so this blog is also a gamble to see if I can improve my writing skill over time. The idea is to spend exactly one hour a week at least until the date of the exam. Thank you for reading, and I hope this is educational.</p>
